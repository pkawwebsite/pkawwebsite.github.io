                    PKAW (Principle and Practice of Data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop) was established in
                    1980s as an integral part of PRICAI (Pacific Rim International Conference on
                    Artificial Intelligence). PKAW 2026 will be held at <strong>the 23rd Pacific Rim
                        International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2026)</strong> in
                    Guangzhou, China. A wide range of topics related to knowledge acquisition and
                    representation are
                    greatly welcome.

                    PKAW will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for, has
                    already
                    been published in, or has already been accepted for publication in, a journal
                    or another venue with formally published proceedings. If part of the work has been
                    previously
                    published, authors are strongly encouraged to cite and compare/contrast the new
                    contributions with the parts that were already published before. The paper must
                    substantially
                    extend the previously published work.

                <p>
                    PKAW 2026 will adopt <strong>single-blind</strong> rule for the reviewing process, i.e., the
                    authors do not know the names of the reviewers, but the reviewers can infer
                    the names of
                    the authors from the submission.

                <p>
                    All papers for the review should be submitted electronically using the conference management
                    tool in PDF format and formatted using the Springer LNCS template. The main content of the
                    paper
                    should <b>not exceed 16 pages long (including references)</b>. For accepted papers, the latex
                    source
                    files and a camera-ready version are required to be submitted using the Springer
                    LNCS template.
